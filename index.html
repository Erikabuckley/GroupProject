                <h1> Who are we? </h1>
                Commit & Pray is a group of students at the University of Exeter that want to help campus users–both staff and students–to understand and reduce their carbon footprints. Having been aware of the University’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions, we started this project with the intention of making monitoring your carbon footprint enjoyable and rewarding. With numerous benefits ranging from the individual to cohort levels, we hope this app can raise awareness of the impact each person has daily on the planet.

                <h1> Why take part? </h1>
                By taking part, you’re helping the University make a real difference and a positive change in working towards the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The University of Exeter is part of the <cite> <a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/staff-news/success-for-exeter-in-global-sustainable-development-rankings/">top 2 percent of institutions worldwide</a></cite> in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings. We owe it not only to ourselves but also future generations to make conscious decisions about our impact on the Earth, because there is no planet B. You will also have the opportunity to compete against other cohorts, encouraging collaboration and reinforcing community. Every little action adds up and makes a meaningful contribution. Even if it’s a small thing each day, you have made a conscious decision about your carbon impact. Logging important actions also makes it easier for the University to report progress.
